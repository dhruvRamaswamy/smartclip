# smartclip
this is a smart clip program on v1.0 with almost no features. The only reason im putting here is for version control.
You use the 'save' command to save a thing that is in your clipboard, you give it a name, and when you want to access that you fire up the program and type this in
This is completely useless so far, i plan to add more to this
